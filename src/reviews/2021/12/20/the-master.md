### I just wanted Joaquin and Philip to kiss


John More: I belong to no club, and if you're unwilling to allow any discussion...

Lancaster Dodd: No, this isn't a discussion, it's a grilling! There's nothing I can do for you, if your mind has been made up. You seem to know the answers to your questions, why do you ask?

John More: I'm sorry you're unwilling to defend your beliefs in any kind of rational...

Lancaster Dodd: If, if you already know the answers to your questions, then why ask PIG FUCK? We are not helpless. And we are on a journey that risks the dark. If you don't mind, a good night to you. 

Yeah paul knows how to write, Hoffman can act especially with joaquin by his side. Astonishing, one of the funniest movies that is very serious. You cannot help yourself sometimes!
