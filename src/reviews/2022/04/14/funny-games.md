“Imagine this movie in the zootopia universe…” 



When I first saw this I watched it on youtube and I swear the shit was from a VHS or something.  But that did not change a thing.  High school Mr. Montana saw this and was in shock of how amazing and creative you really can go with film making, but with such a simple story.  This changed films for me and film making as a whole.  Without Michael Haneke, I would not be a filmmaker today.  Thank you Mr. Haneke. 

This review isn’t even a review, but a thank you to Mr. Haneke, but that is not the only reason I am not saying anything about the story.  The main reason I’m choosing to reveal very little story details is because the best way to watch this film (and any film) is to go in almost completely blind.  Now, that is nearly impossible nowadays, which blows, but trust me when I say try your best going into this one blind.  Also if you ever go to your vacation house, don’t bring eggs or hide them…
